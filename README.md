# answercism
Solutions to problems from Exercism, organized the same way as their CLI does
it. You can actually access the community solutions page by its URL before
solving a problem, so I don't feel too bad about spoiling things.

Not guaranteed to be the best solutions, because I don't want to just copy
something clever someone else had done. It ain't much, but it's mine, as the
saying goes :)
